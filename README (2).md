## Workout-Tracker
Have you ever been to the gym and it takes the same amount of time to find the correct weight
as it does to do the actual move? Have you ever forgotten how many sets or reps you 
wanted to do? 
I've created the workout tracker so you can eaily organize your wokrouts. You can add
each move individually, and then view them by the day you plan to do it. You can also 
update each move, so when you increase the weight you are lifting or the distance you
are running, it is super easy to enter it in.
